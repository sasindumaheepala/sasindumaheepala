### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a young software developer who is eager to contribute to the world of software. I am fairly experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

Programming has always interested me, as I have always wondered how computers do tasks, and how I could control a computer to do a certain task.
