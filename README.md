### Hi there 👋
I am a young software developer that is eager to contribute to the world of software. I am fairly experienced in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Python. I am also learning Java.

Programming has always interested me, as I have always wondered how computers do tasks, and how I could control a computer to do a certain task.

🔭 I’m currently working on the Styled Functional Web Development Language (SFWDL). A draft version of it can be found at:
https://github.com/sasindumaheepala/sasindumaheepala.github.io/tree/main/SFWDL

🌱 I’m currently learning Machine learning.
